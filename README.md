I got tired of every big name password manager getting breached, so I decided to make my own for fun.
This isn’t serious, it's just a password generator at this point. I just wanted to mess around and maybe one day build my own private vault that doesn’t sell my data to space lizards.

This project is purely for fun, experimentation, and personal amusement.
Do not use this at your company, enterprise, government agency, secret underground bunker, or anywhere that requires actual security.
If you use this to generate production passwords, you’re braver than I am (and possibly already breached).
